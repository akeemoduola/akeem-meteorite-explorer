# Meteorite Explorer App

## Chingu Tier-3 Solo Project

This is an application that provides users with the ability to explore meteorite strikes across the globe by searching the Meteorite Landing dataset on the Nasa Open Data Portal.

This application allows you to:
1. List Meteorite landings displayed in alphabetical order on the Name column. 
2. Scroll through the list of landings, or use the search box to search for a name that include the entered search term. 
3. Search through the list. Searches are case independent. This means the user may type searches in lower, upper, or mixed case (like Case, case, or cASe) and the same results will be returned.
4. Reset the list. The results list can be reset to its original contents by clearing the search box and clicking the 'Search' button.
